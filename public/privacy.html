<p>We may share aggregate information with third parties to help us develop content or services.</p>
<p>To customize your experience on this Site and to simplify the Site's registration process, we provide you with the opportunity to access or interact with third-party services, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google Plus.

<p>Note that if the Affinity discloses personal information (including a user's name, address or email) to a third party for direct marketing purposes, under California law Affinity must allow California users to request certain information about the disclosure. The California statute excludes from the definition of direct marketing the use of personal information (a) by bona fide tax exempt charitable or religious organizations to solicit charitable contributions, or (b) to raise funds from and communicate with individuals regarding politics and government. Our understanding is that the Affinity does not intend to disclose users' personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes as defined in the statute.</p>

<p>As is standard practice on many websites, we may set and access cookies, web beacons, Flash cookies, and other technologies on your computer. Please note that third parties, such as ad networks, advertising agencies, advertisers, and audience segment providers, may also set and access cookies, web beacons, Flash cookies, and other technologies on your computer when you visit the Site.</p>
<p>Cookies are small amounts of information stored in files within your computer's browser. Web sites can access only the cookies that they have stored on your computer. For example, if Acme computer company stores a cookie on your browser, Acme may access its own cookie but not that of another company.</p>
<p>The Affinity uses cookies for the following purposes:</p>
<ul class="ml40 mb20">

<li>To help measure and research the effectiveness of our interactive online content, features, and other communications; and
To track Site analytics and use, and to improve Site services.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also use web beacons (known as clear GIFs, web bugs, pixels, or action tags). These technologies are strings of code that deliver a tiny graphic image on a web page or in an email. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on your computer such as cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, and a description of the page on which the web beacon is placed.</p>
<p>We use web beacons for various tracking purposes, like determining whether or not you are logged into the Site and whether or not you are connected to a third-party service.</p>
<p>Third parties also may use web beacons on the Site to receive auditing, research, and reporting information, or to understand your interests and select and deliver to you advertisements that are tailored to your interests.</p>
<p>Some of the Site's third-party partners may use Flash cookies, otherwise known as local shared objects (LSOs), to track user behaviors in various ways. LSOs keep collections of cookie-like data stored in a directory on a user's computer, and are installed through Adobe's Flash video player.</p>
<h5>Collection of Information by Third Parties</h5>
<p>Third party vendors, such as Google DoubleClick, Yahoo Tremor and 24/7 RealMedia, may automatically collect information about your visits to this and other websites, your IP address, your ISP, and the browser you use to visit the Site. They may collect this information using cookies, clear gifs, or other technologies. These third parties may use this information to place ads on other websites or to better understand the usage and visitation of the Site and other websites tracked by these third parties. This Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies, clear gifs or other technologies used by these third parties, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other technologies.</p>
