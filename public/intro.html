<p>You know you <em>have</em> to do something… to get active. Every day there’s a new action alert or Facebook post about a protest or a petition or a call to Congress, and you’re <em>on top of</em> that stuff. But we’re in this for the long haul, and that means building connections with other people who care the way you do. How to do that, when you don’t want to just hand out your email address to a bunch of random fundraising lists, or attend every activist potluck in town?</p>

<p>Sign on with Advocacy Commons, and we’ll give you your own private address, help you find other like-minded activists and groups near you without exposing your location or other private information, and make it easy for you to connect with them through whatever means you prefer — text message, private email, Signal, etc.</p>
