<h4>The Solution</h4>
<p>Build a platform for discovery, collaboration, and safe data sharing between organizations. Take existing social practices of movement building and collaboration and give it a ‘sharing economy’ style platform for it to happen easily.</p>

<p>The lifeblood of organizing is the contact list. Advocacy Commons is a tool for local organizers and a platform to connect them to national networks for coordinated action.</p>

<p>The advocacy commons is an open source advocacy platform built on the <a href="http://opensupporter.org/">Open Supporter - OSDI standard</a> with a focus on connecting organizers to a network of social movements.</p>
